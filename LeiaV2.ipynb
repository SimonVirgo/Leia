You have access to projects and data that you either created or uploaded yourself, or to which your User Account has been granted access by an authorized User.\\\\n\\\\nThe server explorer lists each project with the following basic information:\\\\n\\\\n- Thumbnail  (if applicable and created by a user)\\\\n- Project name\\\\n- Project owner\\\\n- Date of creation\\\\n\\\\nTo create a new project, click the Explorer New button below the explorer ist.\\\\n\\\\nTo delete a project, select it in the list, then click the Delete a Space button below the explorer ist.\\\\n\\\\nControl: ExplorerDataImporter\\\\n\\\\nImport Data\\\\n\\\\nAssigned: Fabian Stamm\\\\nCategory: Getting Started\\\\nControl: ExplorerDataImporter\\\\nPriority: 5\\\\nProduct Version: All\\\\nStatus: Preliminary\\\\nTooltip: Open the \\\\u201cadd data\\\\u201d wizard to import datasets into your space \\\\nlast updated on: June 9, 2023\\\\n\\\\nYou can import data into any Space (including project spaces) loaded in your 3D Workspace.\\\\n\\\\nTo start importing data, select the target space and click on the *Import Data* button in the bottom left of the Local Explorer . \\\\n\\\\n!Screenshot 2022-11-25 at 09.55.44.png\\\\n\\\\nThis will open up the ******************Data Import Wizard****************** which will guide you through the import process for different types of data. For more details on  which data types are currently supported by LiquidEarth, check out the entry Import Formats.\\\\n\\\\n!Screenshot 2022-11-25 at 10.08.51.png\\\\n\\\\nThe import process depends on the type of data you want to add:\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n- **Meshes**\\\\n    - Wavefront OBJ\\\\n    - DXF\\\\n    - OMF\\\\n    - glTF\\\\n- **Boreholes** (coming soon)\\\\n- **Volumes** (coming soon)\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n\\\\nChoose the type of data you want to import and follow the steps elaborated in the wizard. After finalizing the process, the data will be imported into the selected project space. This might happen quickly or take some time depending on the size of the data. A respective message will appear in the activity log and the loading bar will indicate the importing progress.\\\\n\\\\nWith the data loaded, you can now visualize and interact with it using the tools available to you in LiquidEarth (see: Visualization & Basic Interactions and Advanced Interactions).\\\\n\\\\n**Next Step:** Delete Data\\\\n\\\\nControl: EditProjectData\\\\n\\\\nEdit Data\\\\n\\\\nAssigned: Fabian Stamm\\\\nCategory: Explorer Controls\\\\nControl: EditProjectData\\\\nPriority: 10\\\\nProduct Version: All\\\\nStatus: Not started\\\\n\\\\nContent Selection & Navigation\\\\n\\\\nAfter loading a project space containing data into your local workspace (3D Workspace), it will be visualized in 3D. By default, the project space will be displayed with a bounding box which can be used to select the space by clicking on it. The data inside of a space, such as meshes, can also be selected by directly clicking on it. In general, there are various ways to navigate between different selectable content, such as by using the Breadcrumb Trail or simply via the Local Explorer. To learn more about this, see the entry on **Content Navigation**.\\\\n\\\\n!Untitled\\\\n\\\\nIf you have any content selected, it will be highlighted in the workspace and the Inspector (or its respective quickbar) will display options and tools contextual to the content.\\\\n\\\\nLong Description\\\\n\\\\nCreate a new element with respect to the explorer section you have opened:\\\\n\\\\n- In the Server Explorer you can create a new project or Space.\\\\n- In the Local Explorer you can create one of several elements in your local Workspace.\\\\n- In the Annotations Explorer you can create a new Annotation.\\\\n- In the Analysis Explorer you will create a new Probe.\\\\n---------------------\\\\nAnswer the question for a human to understand. Additionally, return the \\'Control\\' properties in the order of operations in the following form at the end of your response: [[control1], [control2], ...].
